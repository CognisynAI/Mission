# MISSION
We are building a simulation/game about the future of our planet and AI, bringing together nature, humans, and AI, to create a global simulation/game based on life centered AI. In our divided world we are unable to address the global challenge of our collective future. Through play we are creating a new way for people to relate to science and nature, to give nature and people a voice in the future of our planet and AI, so we can design a better future for our planet and AI together.

Game Objective: Players from around the world collaborate to draft a comprehensive Bill of Rights for Nature and Humans in the context of advanced AI technologies. The game will simulate real-world scenarios and challenges, requiring players to negotiate, debate, and reach consensus.

Target Audience: The game should be accessible to a wide range of participants â€“ from ordinary people, to scientists, policymakers, legal experts, and technologists to students, and activists. Diversity in participants will enrich the perspectives and solutions proposed.

Scenario-Based Gameplay: Players face various scenarios where AI technologies impact humans and nature. These scenarios can range from environmental challenges, ethical dilemmas in AI usage, to socio-economic impacts of AI on different communities. Players must navigate these scenarios while drafting the Bill of Rights.

Feedback Mechanisms: Incorporates AI-driven simulation models that can predict the outcomes of certain policies or decisions. Additionally, feedback from natural ecosystems (through data on environmental impacts) and public opinion surveys will be integrated to guide decision-making in the game.

Collaborative Tools: The game will provide tools within the game for drafting documents, voting, holding discussions, and forming coalitions or groups. This will simulate real-world legislative and policy-making processes and reimagine them.

Education and Learning: The game will have an educational aspect, teaching players about AI technologies, environmental science, legal principles, and ethical considerations. This will make the game more accessible to those without a background in these areas.

Integrated Reinforcement Learning for AI: Reinforcement learning will be used to adapt the game scenarios based on player decisions, creating a dynamic environment that evolves over time.

Public Engagement and Transparency: 
Outcomes of the game sessions and the evolving draft of the Bill of Rights will be published regularly to encourage public engagement and transparency.

Final Outcome: The ultimate goal will be to create a refined, well-thought-out Bill of Rights that could be presented to real-world organizations and governments for consideration. The game will not only serve as a platform for drafting a vital document but also act as a global educational tool and a means to foster understanding and consensus in our divided world.
