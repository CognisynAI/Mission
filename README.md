# MISSION:
We are building a simulation/game about the future of our planet and AI, bringing together nature, humans, and AI, to create a global simulation/game with life centered AI. In our divided world we are unable to address the global challenge of our collective future. Through play we can create a new way for people to relate to science and nature, to give nature and people a voice in the future of our planet and AI, and put tools of prediction in everyone's hands, so we can design a better future for our planet and AI together.

**Game Objective:**
**A Bill of Rights For A More Than Human World in the AI Era**
Players from around the world collaborate to draft a comprehensive Bill of Rights for Nature and People in the context of advanced AI technologies. The game will simulate real-world scenarios and challenges, requiring players to negotiate, debate, and reach consensus on things like the rights of non human organisms and human rights in the AI era, environmental sustainability, AI governance, ethical use of AI, access to technology, AI and employment, AI and art, and transhuman rights.

**Target Audience:** The game will be accessible to a wide range of participants – people living far from or near to nature, farmers, scientists, policymakers, legal experts, technologists, students, and activists. Diversity in participants will enrich the perspectives and solutions proposed.

**Scenario-Based Gameplay:** Players face various scenarios, in partnership with AI agents, that impact humans and non human organisms and ecosystems. These scenarios can range from environmental challenges, ethical dilemmas in AI usage, to socio-economic impacts of AI on different communities. Players must navigate these scenarios while drafting the Bill of Rights.

**Scenario Development:**
Diverse simulation environments created with muliagent simulation frameworks like Melting Potand net Logo can mirror real-world ecosystems, societal structures, and technological and non human contexts. These scenarios will include elements where AI, nature, and human interests intersect and sometimes conflict, requiring cooperation and negotiation to resolve.

**Role Assignment:**
Participants (AI agents and human players) assume various roles representing different stakeholders, including non humans and natural phenomena, policymakers, activists, scientists and ordinary people, to understand, consider, and reimagine the rights of human and non human organisms & ecosystems, and new institutions of governance to empower such rights. AI agents can be programmed with varying degrees of cooperation and competitiveness to simulate different societal attitudes and alternative perspectives towards nature and technology.

**Game Theory Applications:**
Game theory will be utilized to design scenarios where participants face dilemmas that mirror real-world challenges ( e.g. tragedy of the commons, public goods game). These dilemmas require participants to negotiate, form alliances, and make decisions that can either lead to mutual benefit or collective loss, emphasizing the importance of cooperative strategies.

**Complex Systems Modeling:**
Can simulate the dynamic interactions between different agents and their environment, allowing for emergent behaviors and outcomes. This approach can help identify stable strategies for cooperation and highlight the systemic impacts of individual actions on nature and society.

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
Incorporating AI-driven simulation models can predict the outcomes of certain policies or decisions. Additionally, feedback from natural ecosystems (through data on environmental impacts) and public data sets and opinion surveys can be integrated to guide decision-making in the game. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) will be reimagined to include feedback from non human organisms and ecosystems. 

**A Real World Bill of Rights:** 
The ultimate goal will be to create a refined, well-thought-out Bill of Rights for Nature and People in the AI Era that could be presented to real-world organizations and governments for consideration. The game will not only serve as a platform for drafting a vital document but also act as a global educational tool and a means to foster understanding and consensus in our divided world.


### **COOPERATIVE AI:**
[Cooperative AI](https://www.cooperativeai.com/) is key to improving human and AI cooperation capabilities and creating and impactful bill of rights. Cooperative AI differs from current approaches to AI development where cooperation is a super structure built on a single agent system. Instead, Cooperative AI proposes a multi-agent systems approach, drawing on game theory, complex systems design, environmental science, law, ethics, policy work, education, learning, and inclusivity to advance both AI cooperation and human cooperation.
Important tools for exploration include NetLogo - a multi-agent programmable modeling environment, and DeepMind's Melting Pot - a multi-agent simulation framework designed to test the cooperative and competitive abilities of AI agents in complex, dynamic environments. DM provides a rich platform for simulating interactions in diverse scenarios, enabling better understanding and improvement of the collaborative capabilities of AI, non human organisms/ecosystems, and people. Leveraging Melting Pot to create a global simulation/game aimed at cooperatively crafting a Bill of Rights for nature and humans in the AI era involves several innovative steps. 

### **REGENERATIVE ECONOMICS**
[Regenerative Economics](https://mirror.xyz/austinwadesmith.eth/tv9z1XXrtqQxDIxE8FygZ_W39NpkQJkVfrtjCtdbzA8
) formalize a definition of value which is not predicated upon harvest, but a living world that has value in being alive, and keeping us alive, ie. make the more than human world legible to economics, and rights discourse. Protocols for the stewardship of common resources and public goods in a more-than-human world and the possibility of non-humans to own things. Decentralized protocols for non-human identities. An ecosystem may be a trust or a fund. The design of new ecological institutions that include non human organisms must center on the perspectives and insights of communities that are part of the ecosystem. 


### **ADVANCING COOPERATIVE AI AND HUMAN COOPERATION**
Cooperative AI’s synergies with social sciences, regenerative economics, policy, evolutionary biology, and AI simulations using game theory, and complex system design can advance cooperative AI, human cooperation capabilities, and AI safety and alignment.

**AI as Negotiation Agents:**
Develop AI agents capable of negotiating with both humans and other AI agents to reach consensual decisions. These agents can use advanced algorithms to propose solutions that maximize collective welfare, learning from interactions to improve their proposals over time.

**Human-AI Collaboration:**
Encourage real-time collaboration between human participants and AI agents, leveraging AI to facilitate discussions, generate creative solutions, and model the outcomes of proposed actions. This collaboration can enhance human decision-making with insights drawn from AI analysis and simulation results.

**Collaborative Tools:** 
The game will provide tools within the game for drafting documents, voting, holding discussions, and forming coalitions or groups. This will simulate real-world legislative and policy-making processes and reimagine them.

**Education and Learning:** 
The game will have an educational aspect, teaching players about AI technologies, environmental science, legal principles, and ethical considerations. This will make the game more accessible to those without a background in these areas.

**Public Engagement and Transparency:** 
Outcomes of the game sessions and the evolving draft of the Bill of Rights will be published regularly to encourage public engagement and transparency.

**Crafting the Bill of Rights with Interactive Decision-Making:** 
Through the game, participants work together to address specific issues, draft clauses, and revise proposals for the Bill of Rights. This process is iterative, with multiple rounds of discussion, simulation, and revision based on the outcomes of previous decisions.

**Consensus Building:** Utilize the framework to identify policies and rights that receive broad support from both AI and human participants, focusing on solutions that balance technological advancement with the protection of nature and human rights.
